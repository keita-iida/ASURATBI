Description: ASURATBI is a computational pipeline especially built for computing
    single-cell and spatial transcriptome datasets for our paper publications.
    ASURATBI is a developed version of ASURAT, using several informal packages
    and additional functions. Here, small cell lung cancer, peripheral blood
    mononuclear cells, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma data are analyzed.
